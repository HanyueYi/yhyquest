`\begin{proof}`
Easy.

**Remark**. Let $M$ be an $A$-module, and let $\Sigma=\{\mbox{submodule of }M\}$. If $(\Sigma,\subseteq)$ is the poset in [[MATH/交换代数/Nodes/6 Chain Condition#^1ab5b8\|#^1ab5b8]], then it is denoted as a.c.c. If $(\Sigma,\supseteq)$ is the poset in [[MATH/交换代数/Nodes/6 Chain Condition#^1ab5b8\|#^1ab5b8]], then it is denoted as d.c.c.

**Examples.**
- Any finite abelian group is both Noetherian and Artinian $\mathbb{Z}$-module.
- $\mathbb{Z}$ as a $\mathbb{Z}$-module is a.c.c., not d.c.c.
- Let $G=(\mathbb{Q}/\mathbb{Z})[p^\infty]=\{x\in \mathbb{Q}/\mathbb{Z}:p^nx=0\mbox{ for some }n\geqslant 1\}$, that is, $G$ is a $\mathbb{Z}$-module generated by $\{1/p,1/p^2,\cdots\}$. It is not a.c.c., but it is d.c.c. In fact, since $p^m$ has primitive root, we can prove that all non-trivial submodules are $\mathbb{Z}\cdot\frac{1}{p^n}/\mathbb{Z}$.
	- This example gives a non-Noetherian module over a Noetherian ring, and it gives a Artinian module over a non-Artinian ring. 
- $\mathbb{C}[x_1,\cdots,x_n,\cdots]$ is non-Noetherian and non-Artinian. 

**Remark.** 
- Later in theorem 8.5, Artinian ring $\iff$ Noetherian ring with $\dim=0$. Namely, Artinian rings are the most basic Noetherian rings. （无法理解！）
- However, Artinian modules in general behave poorly.

{ #a5f817}


`\begin{proof}`
i) See [[MATH/抽象代数II/Nodes/2.3 Noetherian Rings and Modules#^0af43c\|2.3 Noetherian Rings and Modules#^0af43c]].

ii) Assume that $M$ is Artinian. For any descending chains $M'=M'_0\supsetneq M_1'\supsetneq\cdots\supsetneq M_n'\supsetneq\cdots$ and $M''=M_0''\supsetneq M_1'\supsetneq\cdots\supsetneq M_n''\supsetneq\cdots$, they induce descending chains of $M$

$$\begin{aligned}
&M=\beta^{-1}(M_0'')\supsetneq\beta^{-1}(M_1'')\supsetneq\cdots\supsetneq\beta^{-1}(M_n'')\supsetneq\cdots ,\\
&M=\alpha(M_0')\supsetneq\alpha(M_1')\supsetneq\cdots\supsetneq\alpha(M_n')\supsetneq\cdots.
\end{aligned}$$

Since $M$ is Artinian, there exist $s$ and $t$ such that $\beta^{-1}(M_k'')=\beta^{-1}(M_{k+1}'')$ and $\alpha(M_t')=\alpha(M_{t+1}')$. Since $\beta$ is surjective and $\alpha$ is injective, it deduces that $M_k''=M_{k+1}''$ and $M_t'=M_{t+1}'$. Hence $M'$ and $M''$ are Artinian. 

Conversely, assume that $M'$ and $M''$ are Artinian. If $M$ has a descending chain which is not stationary

$$M=M_0\supsetneq M_1\supsetneq\cdots\supsetneq M_n\supsetneq \cdots$$

then we have infinitely many short exact sequences $0\to\alpha^{-1}(M_i)\to M_i\to \beta(M_i)\to 0$. Since $M_i\supsetneq M_{i+1}$, at least one of $\{\alpha^{-1}(M_i),\alpha^{-1}(M_{i+1})\}$ and $\{\beta^{-1}(M_i),\beta^{-1}(M_{i+1})\}$ contain two distinct elements. 

Consider the following chains of $M'$ and $M''$ 

$$\begin{aligned}
&M'=\alpha^{-1}(M_0)\supseteq\alpha^{-1}(M_1)\supseteq\cdots\supseteq\alpha^{-1}(M_n)\supseteq\cdots ,\\
&M''=\beta(M_0)\supseteq\beta(M_1)\supseteq\cdots\supseteq\beta(M_n)\supseteq\cdots.
\end{aligned}$$

where some terms may repeat. Since $M'$ and $M''$ are Artinian, these two chains must contain infinitely many same terms. That is, there exists $n_1$ and $n_2$ such that $\alpha^{-1}(M_n)=\alpha^{-1}(M_{n+1})$ for all $n\geqslant n_1$ and $\beta(M_n)=\beta(M_{n+1})$ for all $n\geqslant n_2$. Take $n=n_1+n_2$, then $\alpha^{-1}(M_n)=\alpha^{-1}(M_{n+1})$ and $\beta(M_n)=\beta(M_{n+1})$ hold, which is impossible. 
`\end{proof}`

**Remark.** Similarly to [[MATH/抽象代数II/Nodes/2.3 Noetherian Rings and Modules#^4af1b0\|2.3 Noetherian Rings and Modules#^4af1b0]]., Artinian also has equivalent definition, see [[MATH/抽象代数III/Nodes/3 250311#^ff57ab\|here]].

{ #kwo32n}



> [!proposition]
> Suppose $M$ has a composition series of length $n$. Then every composition series of $M$ has length $n$, and every chain in $M$ can be extended to a composition series.

`\begin{proof}`
Define $\ell(M)$ be the minimal length of all possible composition series. 

**Step 1.** Claim that if $N\subseteq M$, then $\ell(N)\leqslant \ell(M)$. And if $\ell(N)=\ell(M)$, then $M=N$. 

Let $M=M_0\supset M_1\supset\cdots\supset M_{\ell(M)}=0$ be the composition series with the minimal length. Define $N_i=M_i\cap N$, then we have 

$$N=N_0\supseteq N_1\supseteq\cdots\supseteq N_{\ell(M)}=0.\tag{*}$$

But $N_{i-1}/N_i=N\cap M_{i-1}/N\cap M_i$ and there is a injective map $N_{i-1}/N_i\to M_{i-1}/M_i$. As $M_{i-1}/M_i$ is simple, $N_{i-1}/N_i\in\{0,M_{i-1}/M_i\}$. After removing repeated items, $(*)$ becomes a composition series of $N$. Hence $\ell(N)\leqslant \ell(M)$. Also if $\ell(N)=\ell(M)$, then $N_i=M_i$ and so $M=N$. 

**Step 2.** Claim that any chain has length $\leqslant \ell(M)$. 

Indeed, if $M=M_0\supsetneq M_1\supsetneq \cdots\supsetneq M_n=0$, then use step 1, $\ell(M)=\ell(M_0)>\ell(M_1)>\cdots>\ell(M_n)=0$ and so $\ell(M)\geqslant n$.

**Step 3.** By Step 2, any composition series has length $\ell(M)$. 

**Step 4.** Claim that any chain can be refined to be a composition series. 

Indeed, if $M_{i-1}/M_i$ is not simple, then we can strictly add a module $M_{i-1}\supsetneq N\supsetneq M_i$ to make its length strictly bigger. This process stops after finite times by Step 2. 
`\end{proof}`


> [!proposition]
> $M$ has a finite length composition series iff $M$ is Noetherian and Artinian.
{ #a89d3d}


`\begin{proof}`
"->" Both acc and dcc are satisfied because the length of a chain is bounded by Step 2 above.

"<-" $M$ is Noetherian yields $M$ has a proper maximal submodule $M_1$. Then $M_1$ is Noetherian by [[MATH/交换代数/Nodes/6 Chain Condition#^a5f817\|#^a5f817]] and it has a proper maximal submodule $M_2$. The process stops by $M$ Artinian. Since $M_{i}$ is a maximal submodule of $M_{i-1}$, $M_{i-1}/M_{i}$ is simple. Thus, $M$ has a finite length composition series.
`\end{proof}`

**Remark.** For $\mathbb{Z}$-module $\mathbb{Z}$, $\mathbb{Z}\supseteq(2)\supseteq (4)\supseteq (8)\supseteq \cdots$ has a infinite length composition series, and it is not an Artinian ring.

> [!definition]
> If $M$ satisfies [[MATH/交换代数/Nodes/6 Chain Condition#^a89d3d\|#^a89d3d]], then call it *a module of finite length*. Denote $\ell(M)$ as the length of any composition series. 

 **Fact (Jordan-Holder theorem for modules of finite length).** if $\left(M_i\right)_{0<1<\pi}$ and $\left(M_i^{\prime}\right)_{0<1<n}$ are any two composition series of $M$, there is a one-to-one correspondence between the set of quotients $\left(M_{i-1} / M_i\right)_{1<1<n}$ and the set of quotients $\left(M_{i-1}^{\prime} / M_i^{\prime}\right)_{1<1<n}$, such that corresponding quotients are isomorphic. The proof is the same as for finite groups.

> [!proposition]
> Let $0\to M'\to M\to M''\to 0$ be a short exact sequence. Then 
> - $M$ is of finite length iff both $M'$ and $M''$ are of finite length;
> - in this case, $\ell(M)=\ell(M')+\ell(M'')$.

`\begin{proof}`
i) By [[MATH/交换代数/Nodes/6 Chain Condition#^a5f817\|#^a5f817]] and [[MATH/交换代数/Nodes/6 Chain Condition#^a89d3d\|#^a89d3d]]. 

ii) Let $M'=M_0'\supset M_1'\supset\cdots\supset M'_{\ell(M')}=0$ and $M''=M_0''\supset M_1''\supset\cdots\supset M_{\ell(M'')}''=0$ be composition series. Then it is easy to show 

$$M=M_0=\beta^{-1}(M_0'')\supset\beta^{-1}(M_1'')\supset\cdots\supset\beta^{-1}(M_{\ell(M'')}'')=\beta^{-1}(0)=\alpha(M')\supset\cdots\supset \alpha(M'_{\ell(M')})=0$$

is a composition series. 
`\end{proof}`


**Examples.** Here are several examples to compute the length of composition series.
- $\ell_\mathbb{C}(\mathbb{C}[x]/(x^2))=2$, because $\mathbb{C}[x]/(x)\cong \mathbb{C}$ and $\mathbb{C}[x]/(x^2)\big/\mathbb{C}[x]/(x)\simeq (x)/(x^2)\simeq \mathbb{C}$ are simple $\mathbb{C}$-modules. 
- $\ell(\mathbb{Z}/4\mathbb{Z})=2$, because $0\to \mathbb{Z}/2\mathbb{Z}\stackrel{\times 2}{\to} \mathbb{Z}/4\mathbb{Z}\stackrel{\bmod 2}{\to} \mathbb{Z}/2\mathbb{Z}\to 0$ is exact
- $\ell_\mathbb{Z}(\mathbb{Z}[x]/(p^2,x^3))=6$, because $0\to p\mathbb{Z}[x]/(p^2,x^3)\to \mathbb{Z}[x]/(p^2,x^3)\to \mathbb{Z}[x]/(p,x^3)\to 0$ is exact, where $p\mathbb{Z}[x]/(p^2,x^3)\simeq \mathbb{Z}[x]/(p,x^3)\simeq \mathbb{F}_p[x]/(x^3)$. 
	- $\ell_p(\mathbb{F}_p[x]/(x^3))=3$, because $0\to \mathbb{F}_p[x]/(x)\to \mathbb{F}_p[x]/(x^3)\to \mathbb{F}_p[x]/(x^2)\to 0$ is exact and $\ell_p(\mathbb{F}_p[x]/(x^2))=2$. 
	- It deduces that $\ell_\mathbb{Z}(\mathbb{Z}[x]/(p^2,x^3))=2\times 3=6$. See [[Pasted image 20250224204354.png|here]].

`\begin{proof}`
Note that i)->ii)->iii) and i)->ii)->iv) are easy. Then it remains to show iii)->i) and iv)->i).

iii)->i). Otherwise dimension is not finite, then $0\supset ke_1\supset ke_1\oplus ke_2\supset\cdots\supset\oplus_{i=1}^n ke_i\supset\cdots$ is not acc.

iv)->i). Take $V\supset\oplus_{i=1}^\infty ke_i$, then it gives $V\supset\oplus_{i=2}^\infty ke_i\supset\cdots\supset\oplus_{i=n}^\infty ke_i\supset\cdots$ and dcc fails.

> [!proposition]
> Let $A$ be a ring such that $(0)=m_1\cdot m_2\cdots m_n$ is a product of finitely many maximal ideals. then $A$ is Noetherian iff $A$ is Artinian.

`\begin{proof}`
Consider the chain 

$$A\supsetneq m_1\supseteq m_1m_2\supseteq\cdots\supseteq m_1\cdots m_n=0,$$

where each factor $m_1\cdots m_{i-1}/m_1\cdots m_i$ is a $A/m_i$-module as $m_i$ acts on $m_1\cdots m_{i-1}/m_1\cdots m_i$ trivially. Remark that $A/m_i:=k_i$ is a field. By [[MATH/交换代数/Nodes/6 Chain Condition#^e2295f\|#^e2295f]], for each factor we have "acc iff dcc". By [[MATH/交换代数/Nodes/6 Chain Condition#^a5f817\|#^a5f817]], $A$ also satisfies "acc iff dcc".

> We say a topological space $X$ is Noetherian, if its open subsets satisfy a.c.c. If $X$ is Noetherian, then:
> - it is quasi-compact; and

`\begin{proof}`
i) Given any open cover $X=\cup_{i\in I}U_i$, remark that $U_1\subseteq U_1\cup U_2\subseteq\cdots\subseteq \cup_{i\in I}U_i$ has to stop by a.c.c.

ii) Let $Y\subseteq X$. Consider open cover $Y=\cup_{i\in I}V_i$. We aim to get $U_i$ with $U_i\cap Y=V_i$ and $U_i\subsetneq U_{i+1}$. Take any $U_1$. For any $U_2$, take $U_2':=U_2\cup U_1$. That is, change the sequence $\{U_i\}_{i\in I}$ to $\{U_i'=\cup_{j\leqslant i}U_i\}_i$. Then $\{U_i'\}$ stabilizes and so $\{V_i\}$ stabilizes.
