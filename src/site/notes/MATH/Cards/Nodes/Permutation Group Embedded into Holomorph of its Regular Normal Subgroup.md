> [!theorem]
> If $G\leqslant\mathrm{Sym}(\Omega)$ and $G$ has regular normal subgroup $X$, then $G$ on $\Omega$ is permutationally isomorphic to a subgroup $G_R$ of $\mathrm{Hol}(X)$ on $X$ via an natural isomorphism $\theta:G\to G_R$ and a bijection $\beta:\alpha^x\mapsto x$ (for some fixed $\alpha\in\Omega$). 

`\begin{proof}`
Since $X$ is a regular normal subgroup, $\Omega$ can be identified as $X$. Since $X\lhd G$, we have $X_R\lhd G_R$ and so $G_R\leqslant N_{\mathrm{Sym}(\Omega)}(X_R)=\mathrm{Hol}(X)$. Then it is easy to verify it is a permutationally isomorphic.
`\end{proof}`
