> [!proposition]
> Let $G$ be a group such that each Sylow subgroup is cyclic. Then $G$ is solvable. Furthermore, $G$ is metacyclic, i.e., $G/C$ is cyclic and $C$ is cyclic.

`\begin{proof}`
By [[MATH/Cards/Nodes/Burnside's Transfer Theorem#^sezt3q\|Burnside's transfer theorem]], $G$ is solvable. By the property of [[MATH/Cards/Nodes/Fitting Subgroups#^mudriu\|Fitting subgroups]] we obtain that $F:=\mathrm F(G)$ is a cyclic group and so $C_G(F)=F$. Then by [[MATH/Cards/Nodes/NC Lemma\|NC Lemma]], $G/C_G(F)\cong N_G(F)/C_G(F)\lesssim\mathrm{Aut}(F)$ is abelian. Now we finish the proof.
`\end{proof}`
