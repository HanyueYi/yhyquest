`\begin{proof}`
Suppose that $C:=C_{\mathrm{Sym}(\Omega)}(G)$ is transitive. Then for any $\alpha,\beta\in\Omega$, there is $g\in C$ such that $\alpha^g=\beta$. Then we have $G_\alpha=G_\alpha^g=G_{\alpha^g}=G_{\beta}$ for any $\alpha,\beta\in \Omega$. Since $G$ is faithful on $\Omega$, we have $G_\alpha=\{1\}$ for all $\alpha\in\Omega$.

Now suppose that $G$ is semiregular.
