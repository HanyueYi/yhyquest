> [!definition]
> A *$t$-$(v,k,\lambda)$ design* is a point-block geometry $(\mathcal P,\mathcal B)$ where $\mathcal P$ is a set of $v$ points and $\mathcal B$ is a collection of $k$-subsets of $\mathcal P$, with the property that every $t$-subset of $\mathcal P$ is contained in exactly $\lambda$ blocks of $\mathcal B$.
