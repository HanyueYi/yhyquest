#TERMS/representation 

> [!theorem]
> $V$ is a representation of a finite group $G$ over a field $\mathbb{F}$ with characteristic not dividing the order of $G$. If $V$ has a sub-representation $W$, then it has another sub-representation $U$ such that $V=W\oplus U$.


> [!corollary] Maschke's theorem
> Every representation of a finite group $G$ over a field $\mathbb{F}$ with characteristic not dividing the order of $G$ is a direct sum of irreducible representations.
