# Characteristic Subgroup

> [!definition]
> If $G$ is a group, then $H$ is a *characteristic subgroup* of $G$ (written as $H\lhd_\mathrm{char}G$) if every automorphism of $G$ maps $H$ to itself.

> [!proposition]
> If $K\lhd_\mathrm{char}H$ and $H\lhd G$, then $K\lhd G$.

> [!proposition] quotient-transitive
> Suppose $H \leqslant K \leqslant G$ are subgroups such that $H$ is a characteristic subgroup of $G$, and $K / H$ is a characteristic subgroup of $G / H$. Then, $K$ is a characteristic subgroup of $G$.

> [!proposition] transitive
> Suppose $H \leqslant K \leqslant G$ are groups such that $H$ is a characteristic subgroup of $K$, and $K$ is a characteristic subgroup of $G$. Then, $H$ is a characteristic subgroup of $G$.

> [!proposition] centralizer-closed
> Suppose $G$ is a group and $H$ is a characteristic subgroup of $G$. Then, the centralizer $C_G(H)$ of $H$ in $G$ is also a characteristic subgroup of $G$.

> [!proposition] commutator-closed
> Members of the derived series of a group are characteristic subgroups.

怎么感觉之前那个证明 [[MATH/Cards/Nodes/Minimal Normal Subgroup and Maximal Normal Subgroup\|Minimal Normal Subgroup and Maximal Normal Subgroup]] 被绕过去了，好歹毒？

这一堆之前写过了，在这里 [[MATH/Cards/Nodes/Characteristically Simple\|Characteristically Simple]], 合并一下。
