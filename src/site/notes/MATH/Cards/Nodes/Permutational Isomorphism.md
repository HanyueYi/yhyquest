> [!definition]
> Let $G$ be a group acting on a set $\Omega$ and $H$ be a group acting on a set $\Delta$. Then $G$ on $\Omega$ is *permutationally isomorphic* to $H$ on $\Delta$ such that for all $g\in G$ and $\omega\in \Omega$, we have $(\omega^g)\beta=(\omega)\beta^{(g)\theta}$. The pair $(\theta, \beta)$ is called a *permutational isomorphism*.
> 
> Furthermore, if $G=H$ and $\theta=\mathrm{id}$, then we say two actions of $G$ are *equivalent*.

> If $G$ and $H$ are both transitive, then they are permutationally isomorphic iff there is an isomorphism $\theta:G\to H$ such that $\theta$ maps a point stabilizer of $G$ onto some point stabilizer of $H$.
> 
> In particular, if $G$ and $H$ are both subgroups of $\mathrm{Sym}(\Omega)$ for some set of $\Omega$, then $G$ and $H$ are permutationally isomorphic iff they are conjugate in $\mathrm{Sym}(\Omega)$.
