> [!definition]
> For any $a,b\in G$, the *commutator* of $a$ and $b$ is defined by $[a,b]=a^{-1}b^{-1}ab$. The group generated by all commutators of $G$ is called the *derived group* and denoted as $G'=[G,G]$. 

> [!definition]
> The following construction can be iterated:
> - $G^{(0)}:=G$, and
> - $G^{(n)}:=[G^{(n-1)},G^{(n-1)}]$ for $n\in \mathbb{N}_+$.
> 
> The group $G^{(2)},G^{(3)}\dots$ are called the *second derived subgroup*, *third derived subgroup*, and so forth, and the descending normal series 
> 
> $$\dots\lhd G^{(2)}\lhd G^{(1)}\lhd G^{(0)}=G$$

> A group is called a *perfect group*, if its derived group equals to itself. For a finite group $G$, the derived series terminates in a perfect group, denoted as $G^{(\infty)}$. If $G^{(\infty)}=\{1\}$, we say $G$ is *solvable*, otherwise we say $G$ is *nonsolvable*.

`\begin{proof}`
Define the canonical map as $\pi:G\to G/H,\ g\mapsto \overline g$. If $G/H$ is abelian, then $\pi(aba^{-1}b^{-1})=\overline a \overline b \overline a^{-1} \overline b^{-1}=\overline e$ and so $aba^{-1}b^{-1}\in\ker \pi=H$. It yields that $G'\leqslant H$. Conversely, if $aba^{-1}b^{-1}\in H$ for any $a,b\in G$, then $\overline{aba^{-1}b^{-1}}=\overline e$ and $\overline a\overline b=\overline b \overline a$. Therefore, we have $G/H$ is abelian.

> [!proposition]
> A group is [[MATH/Cards/Nodes/Solvable Group\|solvable]] if and only if all its composition factors are abelian.

`\begin{proof}`
Let $G$ be a group and let $1=H_0\lhd \dots\lhd H_n=G$ be a [[MATH/Cards/Nodes/Composition Series\|composition series]] of $G$. We prove the proposition by induction. Assume that the statement is true when the order of group is less than $|G|$. Since $G/H_{n-1}\cong \mathbb{Z}_p$ for some prime $p$, there is $H_{n-1}\geqslant G'$ by [[MATH/Cards/Nodes/Solvable Group#^n7ko5p\|#^n7ko5p]]. By induction hypothesis $H_{n-1}$ is solvable and so for $G'$. Therefore, the group $G$ is a solvable group.
