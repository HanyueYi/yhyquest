> [!theorem] Zsigmondy's theorem
> If $a>b\geqslant 1$ are coprime integers, then for any integer $n\geqslant 2$, there is a prime number $p$, called a *primitive prime divisor*, which divides $a^n-b^n$ and does not divide $a^k-b^k$ for any positive integer $k<n$, with the following exceptions:
> - $n=2$, and $a+b$ is a power of $2$; or
> - $(a,b,n)=(2,1,6)$.
