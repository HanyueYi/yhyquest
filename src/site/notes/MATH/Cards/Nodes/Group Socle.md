> [!Definition]
> The socle of a group is the subgroup generated by all its minimal normal subgroups.

> [!proposition]
> The socle of a finite group is a direct product of simple groups.

`\begin{proof}`
Note that any different minimal normal subgroups intersects trivially, see [[MATH/Cards/Nodes/Normal Subgroups that Intersect Trivially\|here]]. Then by [[MATH/Cards/Nodes/Minimal Normal Subgroup and Maximal Normal Subgroup\|this lemma]] the socle is a direct product of simple groups.
`\end{proof}`
