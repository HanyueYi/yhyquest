> [!Theorem]
> Let $G\leqslant\mathrm{GL}(V)$ be a transitive linear group acting on $V$ with $V\cong\mathbb{F}_p^n$.
> Then one of the followings holds.
> - $G$ is solvable and either $G\leqslant\mathrm{\Gamma L}_1(p^n)$, or $G$ has a normal subgroup isomorphic to $2^{1+2}_-$ or $\mathrm{SL}_2(3)$, and $(n,p)\in\{(2,3),(2,5),(2,7),(2,11),(2,23),(4,3)\}$.
> - $G^{(\infty)}$ is isomorphic to one of $\mathrm{SL}_m(q)$, $\mathrm{Sp}_{m}(q)$ and $G_2(q)$ ($m=6$ and $q$ even) with $q=p^f$ and $n=mf$. In this case, we say that $G$ is of **classical type**.
> -  $G^{(\infty)}$ is isomorphic to one of groups in $\{\mathrm{SL}_2(5),A_6,A_7,\mathrm{PSU}_3(3),\mathrm{SL}_2(13),2_{-}^{1+4}.A_5\}$, and $(n,p)\in\{(2,11),(2,19),(2,29),(2,59),(4,2),(4,3),(6,2),(6,3)\}$. In this case, we say that $G$ is of **sporadic type**. Also see [[Pasted image 20240729162634.png|here]].
