> [!lemma] Schur's lemma
> Let $V$ and $W$ be two finite-dimensional irreducible representations of a group $G$ and $\phi:V\to W$ is $FG$-homomorphism, then either $\phi$ is invertible, or $\phi=0$. Moreover, if $V=W$, then $\phi$ is an isomorphism.

**Remark.** If $F=\mathbb{C}$ and $V=W$, then a non-zero $\phi:V\to V$ is a scalar multiple of the identity endomorphism (see [[MATH/Representations and Characters of Groups/Nodes/2 Group Algebra#^po1qjp\|here]]).
