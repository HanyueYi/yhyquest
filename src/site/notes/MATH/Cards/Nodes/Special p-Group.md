> [!definition] from [[Li 和 Zhu - 2024 - The finite groups with three automorphism orbits.pdf|here]]
> A non-abelian $p$-group $N$ is said to be a special $p$-group if $\mathrm Z(N)=\Phi(N)=N'$ is elementary abelian.

[[MATH/Cards/Nodes/Frattini Subgroup#^k9gxk1\|Recall]] that $N/\Phi(N)$ is also elementary abelian. Let $V$ and $M$ be the corresponding $\mathbb{F}_pG$-modules of $N/\Phi(N)$ and $\Phi(N)$. By [[Li 和 Zhu - 2024 - The finite groups with three automorphism orbits.pdf#page=5&selection=656,0,657,0|Lemma 2.8(iv)]], $M$ is isomorphic to the [[Representation Theory 101/Nodes/Symmetric and Anti-symmetric Squares\|exterior square]] of $V$ as $\mathbb{F}_pG$-modules.

Since $N'=[N,N]=\mathrm Z(N)$, we have that the [[MATH/Cards/Nodes/Nilpotent Group\|nilpotency class]] of $N$ is $2$.
