> [!lemma]
> Let $G,G'$ be groups, and let $H$ be a subgroup of $G\times G'$ such that the two projections $p_1:H\to G$ and $p_2:H\to G'$ are surjective (i.e., $H$ is a subdirect product of $G$ and $G')$. Let $N$ be the kernel of $p_2$ and $N'$ the kernel of $p_1.$ One can identify $N$ as a normal subgroup of $G$, and $N'$ as a normal subgroup of $G'$. Then the image of $H$ in $G/N\times G'/N'$ is the graph of an isomorphism $G/N\cong G'/N'$. One then obtains a bijection between:
> - Subgroups of $G\times G'$ which project onto both factors, and
> - Triples $(N,N',f)$ with $N$ normal in $G,N'$ normal in $G'$ and $f$ isomorphism of $G/N$ onto $G'/N'$.
