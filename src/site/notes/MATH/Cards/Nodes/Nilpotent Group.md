**Observations.**
{ #0b8777}

- A nilpotent group is a solvable group.
- For any prime $p$, a $p$-group is a nilpotent group.
- Direct product of two nilpotent groups is nilpotent.
- $A_4$ and $S_4$ are not nilpotent.
- Note that $Z_{n-i}\geqslant K_{i}\geqslant G_i$. (Maybe that's why they are called upper/lower central series.)

`\begin{proof}`
Assume (i) holds. Then $G$ has a central series

$$G=K_1>K_2>\cdots>K_{s+1}=1.$$

Let $H<G$. Then there exists $i$ such that $H\geqslant K_{i+1}$ and $H\not\geq K_i$. It yields that $[H/K_{i+1},Z(G/K_{i+1})]=1$. So for any $h\in H$ and $y\in K_i$, there is $(hK_{i+1})(yK_{i+1})=(yK_{i+1})(hK_{i+1})$ and so $hy=(yc_1)(hc_2)$ for some $c_1,c_2\in K_{i+1}$. We have

$$(yc_1)(hc_2)=yhc_1^hc_2=yhc_1'c_2\in yhK_{i+1}.$$

So $y^{-1}hy=hc_1'c_2\in HK_{i+1}=H$, i.e. $y\in N_G(H)$ and $K_i\leqslant N_G(H)$. Thus $N_G(H)\geqslant HK_i>H$, as in (ii).

Assume (ii) holds. Let $M$ be a maximal subgroup of $G$. Then $M\lhd N_G(M)\leqslant G$ and so $M\lhd G$. The factor group $G/M$ does not have a proper subgroup as $M$ is maximal. So $|G/M|$ is a prime, as in (iii).

Assume (iii) holds. Let $P\in\mathrm{Syl}_p(G)$. If $P$ is not normal in $G$, then $P<G$ and $P<N_G(P)<G$. Let $M$ be a maximal subgroup of $G$ such that $N_G(P)\leqslant M<G$. Then $M\lhd G$. By [[MATH/Cards/Nodes/Frattini's Argument\|Frattini's argument]], $G=N_G(P)M=M$, a contradiction. Hence, $P\lhd G$ and so $G$ is a direct product of Sylow subgroups.

Assume (iv) holds. [[MATH/Cards/Nodes/Nilpotent Group#^0b8777\|Since]] $p$-group is nilpotent and direct product of nilpotent groups is nilpotent, we obtain (i). 
`\end{proof}`

**Remark.** [[MATH/Cards/Nodes/Normalizer of p-subgroup#^srj1g6\|Note]] that $N_G(N_G(P))=N_G(P)$ for any Sylow $p$-subgroup. So (ii)->(iv) is easy.
