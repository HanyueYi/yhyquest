> [!definition]
> A *partial linear space* is a non-empty set of points, provided with a collection of subsets called lines such that any pair of points is contained in at most one line and every line contains at least two points.
> 
> A partial linear space which is not a graph or a linear space is called *proper*.

> [!definition]
> Suppose that $G$ is an automorphism group of a proper partial linear space. If $G$ is transitive on the ordered pairs of collinear points, as well as on the ordered pairs of non-collinear points, $G$ is called *2-ultrahomogeneity*.

> [!lemma]
> If $G$ is an automorphism group of a proper partial linear space $S =(\mathcal P,\mathcal L)$ acting $2$-ultrahomogeneously on it, then $G$ is a rank $3$ permutation group on $\mathcal P$.
