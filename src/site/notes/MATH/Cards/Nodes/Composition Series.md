> [!definition]
> A *composition series* of a group $G$ is a subnormal series of finite length

> $$1=H_0\lhd H_1\lhd\dots\lhd H_n=G,$$

The composition series of a finite group is unique in a certain sense, as the following theorem shows.

> [!theorem] Jordan-Holder theorem
> Any two composition series of a given group are equivalent. That is, they have the same composition length and the same composition factors, up to permutation and isomorphism.

**Remark.** This theorem is also true for [[Representation Theory 101/Nodes/Composition Series of Modules\|Composition Series of Modules]].
