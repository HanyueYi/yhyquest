> A permutation group is said to be quasiprimitive if all its non-trivial normal subgroups are transitive.{ #8e7xfa}


Let $G$ be a quasiprimitive permutation group on $\Omega$, and let $N=\mathrm{soc}(G)$, the socle of $G$ generated by all minimal normal subgroups. Then $N=T^n$, where $T$ is simple and $n$ is a positive integer. [[Literature/Nodes_new/Finite quasiprimitive graphs\|Praeger]] shows that there are the following eight types.
- (HS) holomorph simple: $N$ is a product of two minimal subgroups which are nonabelian simple
- (HC) holomorph compound: $N$ is a product of two minimal normal subgroups which are not simple;
- (HA) Holomorph affine: $N$ is abelian
- (AS) almost simple: $N$ is simple, and $C_G(N)=1$;
- (TW) twisted wreath product: $N$ is nonabelian, non-simple, and regular;
- (SD) simple diagonal: point stabilizer $N_\omega$ is simple and isomorphic to $T$;
- (CD) compound diagonal: point stabilizer $N_\omega\cong T^k$ with $k\geq 2$.
- (PA) product action: $N$ has no normal subgroup which is regular on $\Omega$.
