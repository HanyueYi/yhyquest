> [!definition]
> A tableau $t$ is called standard if the rows and the columns of $t$ are increasing sequences. 
{ #8pq74m}


In this section, we aim to prove the following theorem. The proof is written [[MATH/代数专题/Nodes/10.5 Basis of Specht Modules#^goswcn\|here]]. 

> [!theorem]
> The set $\{e_t:t\mbox{ is a standard }\lambda\mbox{-tableau}\}$ is a basis of Specht module $S^\lambda$. 
{ #030a4e}


We call a sequence $\lambda=(\lambda_1,\cdots,\lambda_k)$ with $\lambda_1+\cdots+\lambda_k=n$ is a composition of $n$, and $\lambda_i$ is called part of $\lambda$. (Compare with partition: composition with $\lambda_1\geqslant \cdots\geqslant\cdots\lambda_k$.) We say that composition $\lambda$ dominates $\mu$, if for any $k\geqslant 1$ there is $\lambda_1+\cdots+\lambda_k\geqslant \mu_1+\cdots+\mu_k$. 

Suppose $\{t\}$ is a tabloid of shape $\lambda\vdash n$. For each $i=1,\cdots,n$, define $\{t^i\}$ as the tabloid formed by all elements $\leqslant i$ in $\{t\}$, and define $\lambda^i$ as the composition which is the shape of $t^i$. Here is an example:

![Pasted image 20241125143011.png|500](/img/user/%E9%99%84%E4%BB%B6/Pasted%20image%2020241125143011.png)

There is a way to order tabloids in the same shape.

> [!definition]
> Let $\{t\}$ and $\{s\}$ be two tabloids in $\lambda$-shape with the corresponding composition $\lambda^i$ and $\mu^i$. We say that $\{s\}$ dominates $\{t\}$, denoted by $\{s\}\rhd\{t\}$ if $\mu^i\rhd \lambda^i$ for all $i$.

**Remark.** Not all tabloids can be compared. For example, take 

$$\{t\}=\left\{\
\begin{matrix} 1 & 3 & 4\\
2 & 5  \end{matrix}\right\}\mbox{ and }
\{s\}=\left\{
\begin{matrix} 1 & 2 & 5 \\
3 & 4  \end{matrix}\right\}.$$

Note that $\lambda^2=(1,1)\lhd \mu^2=(2,0)$ and $\lambda^4=(3,1)\rhd\mu^4=(2,2)$. 

> [!lemma]
> If $k<\ell$ and $k$ occurs in a lower row than $\ell$ in $\{t\}$, then $\{t\}\lhd(k,\ell)\{t\}$.

`\begin{proof}`
Let $\lambda^i$ and $\mu^i$ be composition sequences for $\{t\}$ and $(k,\ell)\{t\}$, respectively. If $k\leqslant i\leqslant \ell$, and suppose $\ell$, $k$ is in row $q$, $r$ of $\{t\}$ respectively, then 

$$(\lambda^i)_q=(\mu^i)_q-1,(\lambda^i)_r=(\mu^i)_r+1$$

and so $\lambda^i\lhd \mu^i$ for all $i$. [[Pasted image 20241128202606.png|Here]] is a illustration.
`\end{proof}`


> [!corollary]
> If $v=\sum_i c_i\{t_i\}\in M^\lambda$, we say that $\{t_i\}$ appears in $v$ if $c_i\neq 0$. If $t$ is a [[MATH/代数专题/Nodes/10.5 Basis of Specht Modules#^8pq74m\|standard tableau]] and $\{s\}$ appears in $e_t$, then $\{t\}\rhd \{s\}$. 

`\begin{proof}`
Write $s=\pi t$ with $\pi\in C_t$. 

We do induction on number of "inversions" in $s$, that is, the number of pairs $(k,\ell)$ such that $k\leqslant \ell$ and $k,\ell$ are in the same column but $k$ is in lower row than $\ell$. Then $\{s\}\lhd (k,\ell) \{s\}$ for each inversion and thus $\{s\}\lhd \{t\}$. Here is an example.

![Pasted image 20241125150516.png|500](/img/user/%E9%99%84%E4%BB%B6/Pasted%20image%2020241125150516.png)

For the last term $\{s\}$, $\{1,2\}$ and $\{3,4\}$ are two inversions. By [[MATH/代数专题/Nodes/10.5 Basis of Specht Modules#^rswrnz\|#^rswrnz]], $\{s\}\lhd (12)\{s\}\lhd (12)(34)\{s\}=\{t\}$.
`\end{proof}`


Now we are ready to prove [[MATH/代数专题/Nodes/10.5 Basis of Specht Modules#^030a4e\|#^030a4e]].
{ #goswcn}


`\begin{proof}`
First we prove that they are linear independent. Suppose $c_1e_{t_1}+\cdots+c_ne_{t_n}=0$, and we label $\{t_1\}$ in such way that there is no $i>1$ with $\{t_1\}\rhd \{t_i\}$. Then by corollary $\{t_1\}$ only appears in $e_{t_1}$ and so $c_1=0$. By induction all $c_i=0$, contradiction. 

Next we prove that standard polytabloids of shape $\lambda$ span $S^\lambda$. For a polytabloid $e_t$ with tableau $t$, we may assume that column of $t$ are increasing by replacing $e_t$ with $e_{\sigma t}=\sigma e_t=\mathrm{sgn}(\sigma)e_t$ for some suitable $\sigma\in C_t$. Then if $t$ is not standard, we will find two adjacent elements in one row with $t_{i,j}>t_{i,j+1}$. Now we aim to find a linear combination of polytabloids where this row descent is eliminated. This algorithm uses [Garnir relations](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Garnir_relations), as the following example shows.

>

With this example, it suffices to show $g_{A,B}e_t=0$. 

> [!proposition] 
> For a tableau $t$ with a row descent and the corresponding sets $A$ and $B$, we have $g_{A,B}e_t=0$. 
>
{ #791bdb}


`\begin{proof}`
We claim that $S^-_{A\sqcup B}e_t=\{0\}$. Since $|A|+|B|$ is greater than the size of column containing $A$, for any $\sigma\in C_t$ there exist $a,b\in A\sqcup B$ which are in the same row of $\sigma t$. Then by [[MATH/代数专题/Nodes/10.4 Complete List of Irreducible Modules#^fae9c5\|10.4 Complete List of Irreducible Modules#^fae9c5]], $(ab)\in S_{A\sqcup B}$ yields that $S^-_{A\sqcup B}\{\sigma t\}=\{0\}$. Since $e_t=\sum_{\sigma\in C_t}\mathrm{sgn}\sigma\{\sigma t\}$, there is $S^-_{A\sqcup B}e_t=\{0\}$.

Then consider the coset decomposition of $S_{A\sqcup B}$. Note that 

$$S_{A\sqcup B}=\pi_1(S_A\times S_B)\sqcup\cdots\sqcup \pi_\ell(S_A\times S_B)$$

where $g_{A,B}=\sum_{k=1}^\ell\mathrm{sgn}\pi_i\cdot \pi_i$. Hence, $S_{A\sqcup B}^-=g_{A,B}(S_A\times S_B)^-$. For any element $\tau\in S_A\times S_B$, $\tau e_t=\mathrm{sgn}\tau\cdot e_t$ and so $(S_A\times S_B)^- e_t=|S_A\times S_B|e_t$. Therefore, 

$$\{0\}=S^-_{A\sqcup B}e_t=g_{A,B}(S_A\times S_B)^- e_t=g_{A,B}|S_A\times S_B|e_t$$

yields that $g_{A,B}e_t=0$.
`\end{proof}`

Now we finish the proof of [[MATH/代数专题/Nodes/10.5 Basis of Specht Modules#^030a4e\|#^030a4e]]. 
`\end{proof}` 


Now we get a basis of Specht module $S^\lambda$. The corresponding representation of it, is Young natural representation.

Recall that $S_n$ is generated by transpositions $(k\;k+1)$, then we denote $s_k=(k\; k+1)$. For $e_t$ be a polytabloid corresponding to standard tableau, there is
- if $k$ and $k+1$ are in the same column, then $s_ke_t=-e_t$;
- if $k$ and $k+1$ are in the same row, then $(k\;k+1)e_t$ will have row descent and then apply Garnir element;
- if $k$ and $k+1$ are in different columns and different rows, then $(k\; k+1)e_t$ is another polytabloid corresponding to standard tableau.

Therefore, each transposition $(k\;k+1)$ induces a linear transformation on the subspace spanned by s polytabloids corresponding to standard tableaus. We refer to this representation as *Young natural representation*.

**Remark.** Every irreducible representation of $S_n$ has integer values, in particular defined over $\mathbb{R}$. Hence, all representations are of [[MATH/代数专题/Nodes/7 Character Table, Frobenius-Schur Indicator & Complexification#^df16b3\|symmetric type]].
