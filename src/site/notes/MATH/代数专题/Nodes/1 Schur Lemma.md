> [!definition]

> [!definition] dual representation
> Suppose $V$ is a $G$-module. Let $V^*=\mathrm{Hom}_k(V,k)$, and let $\rho^*$ is a representation of $G$ on $V^*$. For any $f\in\mathrm{Hom}_k(V,k)$, define $\rho^*(g)f=f\circ\rho(g^{-1})$. Then $\rho^*$ is a representation of $G$ in $V^*$.

> [!definition]
> We call a $G$-module $V$ irreducible, if $V$ and $\{0\}$ are only $G$-invariant subspaces.

For example, let $G=S_n$ and $\sigma:G\to\mathrm{GL}_n(k),\sum\alpha_ie_i\mapsto \sum\alpha_i e_{\sigma(i)}$. Then $D:=\{(\alpha,\cdots,\alpha):\alpha\in k\}$ and $W:=\{(\alpha_1,\cdots,\alpha_n):\sum\alpha_i=0\}$ are two $G$-invariant subspaces, and $V=D\oplus W$. 

> [!lemma] Schur lemma
> A morphism between irreducible representations of groups is either zero or isomorphism.
> 
> If $k$ is algebraically closed field, $\rho$ is a irreducible representation of $G$ in $V$, $\dim V<\infty$ and $S:V\to V$ morphism of $G$-modules, then there exists $\lambda\in k$ such that $S=\lambda\mathrm{Id}$. 

`\begin{proof}`
i) Let $T:V\to W$ be a morphism with $V,W$ irreducible. Since $\ker T$ and $\mathrm{Im}T$ are submodules of $V$ and $W$, respectively, then one of the following holds:
- $\ker T=V$, $\mathrm{Im}T=0$
- $\ker T=0$, $\mathrm{Im}T=W$

Thus either $T$ is zero or isomorphism.

ii) Let $\lambda$ be a root of the characteristic polynomial $p_S(\lambda)$. Then $\ker(S-\lambda I)\neq\{0\}$ and $S-\lambda I$ is also a morphism. By i) we have that $\ker(S-\lambda I)=V$. Therefore, $S=\lambda I$. 
`\end{proof}`

> [!lemma]
> Any irreducible representation of finite group is of finite dimension.

`\begin{proof}`
Let $V$ be a irreducible representation of $G$. For any nonzero $v\in V$, define $W:=\left\langle v\right\rangle=\{gv:g\in G\}$. Then $\dim W<\infty$ by $|G|<\infty$. Since $W$ is $G$-invariant, we have that $W=V$ and so $V$ is of finite dimension.
`\end{proof}`
