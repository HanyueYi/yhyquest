# Parity and Presentation of Symmetric Groups

> [!definition] parity
> Each permutation in $S_n$ can be presented as a diagram permutation said to be odd (rep. even) if the number of crossing in this diagram is odd (rep. even). Define $\mathrm{sgn}:S_n\to\{\pm1\}$ as $\mathrm{sgn}(\sigma)=1$ if $\sigma$ is even and $\mathrm{sgn}(\sigma)=-1$ if $\sigma$ is odd.

> 
> Equivalently, the parity of permutation $\sigma$ is the number of inversions $(i,j)$ in $\sigma$: $1\leqslant i<j\leqslant n$ such that $\sigma(i)<\sigma(j)$.


The adjacent transposition $s_i:=(i\;i+1)$ for all $1\leqslant i\leqslant n-1$, then $S_n$ is generated by $\{s_i:1\leqslant i\leqslant n-1\}$. 


> [!proposition]
> The symmetric group has the following presentation 
> 
> $$S_n=\left\langle s_1,\cdots,s_{n-1}: s_i^2=1,s_is_j=s_js_i\mbox{ with }|i-j|>2,s_is_{i+1}s_i=s_{i+1}s_is_{i+1}\right\rangle .$$

`\begin{proof}` 
Define the LHS equals $\Gamma_n$. We have a surjective homomorphism $\Gamma_n\to S_n,s_i\mapsto (i\;i+1)$. It suffices to show $|\Gamma_n|\leqslant n!$. Note that the case of $n=1$ holds. Suppose that $|\Gamma_{n}|\leqslant n!$, and consider the subgroup $H<\Gamma_{n+1}$ generated by $s_1,\cdots,s_{n-1}$where $|H|\leqslant n!$ by induction hypothesis. Note that 

$$\Gamma_{n+1}=H\cup s_n H\cup\cdots\cup s_1\cdots s_n H$$

and this composition is stable by the action of $n$. Therefore, $|\Gamma_{n+1}|\leqslant (n+1)!$ and so $\Gamma_n\simeq S_n$.
`\end{proof}`


> [!definition]
> Any element of $S_n$ can be written as product of $s_i$'s, and for $\sigma=s_{i_1}\cdots s_{i_\ell}$, then minimum value of $\ell$ is called the length of $\sigma$.


# Cycle Types and Partitions

> [!definition]
> Any permutation $\sigma$ can be written as product of disjoint cycles. The cycle type is the set of length of cycles. For example, the cycle type of $(1234)(567)$ in $S_8$ is $\{1,3,4\}$. 
> 
> As two permutations with the same cycle type belong to the same conjugacy class, the conjugacy classes of $S_n$ can be described  as $\lambda=(\lambda_1,\cdots,\lambda_\ell)$ with $\lambda_i>0,\lambda_i\in \mathbb{Z}$ and $\lambda_1+\cdots+\lambda_{\ell}=n$.

[[399941730704320_.pic.jpg|There]] are some properties of [partition functions](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Partition_function_(number_theory)). Write partition in the multiplicity from $\lambda=\{1^{m_1},\cdots,n^{m_n}\}$ with $n=m_1+2m_2+\cdots+nm_n$, then we have the following property.

> [!proposition]
> The cardinality of conjugacy class $C_\lambda$ of $S_n$ corresponding to partition $\lambda=\{1^{m_1},\cdots, n^{m_n}\}$ is 
> 
> $$|C_\lambda|=\frac{n!}{1^{m_1}m_1!\cdots n^{m_n}m_n!}.$$

`\begin{proof}`
Note that 
- $(123),(231),(312)$ are same cycles and there are $1^{m_1}\cdots n^{m_n}$ repetitions.
- $(123)(456)$ and $(456)(123)$ are same cycles and there are $m_1!\cdots m_n!$ repetitions.

Now we finish the proof.
`\end{proof}`

For any given $n\in \mathbb{N}_+$, define $p(n)$ as the number of partitions of $n$. Then we can get its generating function.


> [!theorem] Euler formula
> The generating function for partition is 
> 
> $$\sum_{n\geqslant 0}p(n)t^n=\frac{1}{1-t}\frac{1}{1-t^2}\cdots\frac{1}{1-t^n}\cdots$$
> 
> where $p(n)$ is the number of partitions of $n$.
