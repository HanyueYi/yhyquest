> - Let $(X, \mathcal{A})$ be a measurable space. A function $f: X \rightarrow \overline{\mathbb{R}}$ is measurable if it is measurable with respect to the Borel $\sigma$-algebra on $\overline{\mathbb{R}}$ associated to the standard topology as defined above.
> - Let $X$ and $Y$ be topological spaces. A map $f: X \rightarrow Y$ is called Borel measurable if the pre-image of every Borel measurable subset of $Y$ under $f$ is a Borel measurable subset of $X$.

**Remark.** $\overline {\mathbb{R}}$ is defined as $\mathbb{R}\cup\{\infty\}\cup\{-\infty\}$. A subset of $\overline{\mathbb{R}}$ is open, if it is a countable union of the set of the form: $[-\infty,a),(a,\infty],(a,b)$. 

**Example.** Define $\chi_A:X\to\mathbb{R}$ as $\chi_A(x)=1$ if $x\in A$; $\chi_A(x)=0$ if $x\not\in A$. Then $\chi_A$ is measurable iff $A$ is a measurable set.

`\begin{proof}`
Let $O$ be the open subset in $\mathbb{R}^n$. Define $X:=\{x\in O:x=(x_1,\cdots,x_n),x_i\in \mathbb{Q} \}$. Then $X$ is a countable set. For each $x\in X$, define $R_x=(a_1,b_1)\times\cdots\times (a_n,b_n)$ be the maximal cube such that $R_x\subseteq O$. Then $\cup_{x\in X} R_x=O$. 
`\end{proof}`

> [!proposition] vector valued measurable functions
> Let $(X, \mathcal{A})$ be a measurable space and let $f=\left(f_1, \cdots, f_n\right): X \rightarrow \mathbb{R}^n$ be a function. Then $f$ is measurable if and only if $f_i: X \rightarrow \mathbb{R}$ is measurable for each $i$.

`\begin{proof}`
Note that $f_i=\pi_i\circ f$ and $\pi_i$ is continuous, then $f_i$ is measurable. Now assume that $f_i$ is measurable for each $i$. Let $Q(a,b)=(a_1,b_1)\times\cdots\times(a_n,b_n)$. Then 

$$f^{-1}(Q(a,b))=\cap\{x\in X:f_i(x)\in(a_i,b_i)\}=\cap f_i^{-1}((a_i,b_i))\in\mathcal{A} .$$

Since any open subset in $\mathbb{R}^n$ is a countable union of the set $Q(a,b)$ by [[MATH/测度论/Nodes/5 Measurable Function#^2bca2c\|#^2bca2c]], then $f$ is measurable.

`\begin{proof}`
Since $f:=(u,v)$ and $\phi$ are measurable, then $h$ is measurable.

`\begin{proof}`
i) By [[MATH/测度论/Nodes/5 Measurable Function#^12414f\|#^12414f]].

ii) Define $g:=\sup _k f_k: X \rightarrow \overline{\mathbb{R}}$ and let $a \in \mathbb{R}$. Then the set

$$
\begin{aligned}
g^{-1}((a, \infty]) & =\left\{x \in X: \sup _i f_i(x)>a\right\}=\left\{x \in X: \exists i \text { such that } f_i(x)>a\right\} \\
& =\bigcup_{i=1}^{\infty}\left\{x \in X \mid f_i(x)>a\right\}=\bigcup_{i=1}^{\infty} f_i^{-1}((a, \infty]) .
\end{aligned}
$$

is measurable. Hence it follows that $g$ is measurable. It also follows that $-f_k$ is measurable, and hence the function $\inf f_k=-\sup \left(-f_k\right)$ is measurable. Also we conclude that the functions

$$
\limsup _k f_k=\inf _{l \in \mathbb{N}} \sup _{k \geq l} f_k ; \liminf _k f_k=\sup _{l \in \mathbb{N}} \inf _{k \geq l} f_k
$$

are also measurable.
`\end{proof}`

> [!corollary]
> If $f_n:X\to \overline {\mathbb{R}}$ is measurable and $f_n(x)\to f(x)$ for all $x$, then $f:X\to \mathbb{R}$ is measurable.

`\begin{proof}`
By [[MATH/测度论/Nodes/5 Measurable Function#^e11178\|#^e11178]], ii).
`\end{proof}`

> [!proposition]
> If $f:\mathbb{R}\to \mathbb{R}$ is monotone, then $f$ is Borel measurable.

`\begin{proof}`
Suppose that $f$ is increasing, for otherwise let $g=-f$. For any $a\in \mathbb{R}$, define $x_0=\sup\{x:f(x)\leqslant a\}$. 
- If $f(x_0)>a$, then $f^{-1}((a,\infty))=[x_0,\infty)$.
- If $f(x_0)\leqslant a$, then $f^{-1}((a,\infty))=(x_0,\infty)$. 

Therefore, $f^{-1}((a,\infty))$ is measurable and so $f$ is Borel measurable.
