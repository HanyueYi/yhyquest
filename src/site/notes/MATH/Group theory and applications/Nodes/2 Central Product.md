Suppose $G=HK$ and $N\lhd K$. Then

$$G/N=(HN/N)(KN/N),$$

is denoted by $\bar G=\bar H\bar K$. Note that a quotient of an exact factorization is not necessarily exact.

# Internal Central Product

**Def.** A group $G$ is called an *internal central product* of two of its subgroups $A$ and $B$ if it is generated by them, if $ab=ba$ for any two elements $a \in A$ and $b \in B$ and if the intersection $A \cap B$ lies in the center $\mathrm{Z}(G)$. In particular, for $A \cap B = \{1\}$ the central product turns out to be the direct product $A \times B$. 

# External Central Product

The *external central product* of $A$ and $B$ can be defined without assuming in advance that $A$ and $B$ are subgroups of a certain group $C$. More explicitly, see the following definition.

> [!definition]
> Let $G=H\times K$. Assume that $C_1\leqslant Z(H)$, $C_2\leqslant Z(K)$ and $C_1\cong C_2$. Let $\phi$ be an isomorphism from $C_1$ to $C_2$. Let $N=\big<(x,x^\phi):x\in C_1\big>\lhd G$. Then $\bar G= \bar H\bar K$ s.t. $\bar H\cong H$ and $\bar K\cong K$. The group $\bar G=H\times K/N:=H\circ_N K$ is called the *external central product* of $H,K$ w.r.t. $N$.

**Example.** Let $H=Q_8$ and $K=D_8$. Since $Z(H)=\big<c_1\big>\cong Z_2$ and $Z(K)=\big<c_2\big>\cong Z_2$, take $N=\big<(c_1,c_2)\big>\lhd G=H\times K$. Then $\bar G=H\circ K$.
