> [!definition]
> Let $G$ be a finite group. $H,K<G$ is called a *factorization* if $G=HK$, i.e. any $g\in G$ has the form $g=hk$, where $h\in H$, $k\in K$. Groups $H,K$ are called *factors*, and $K$ is called a *supplement* of $H$ in $G$. Furthermore, if $H\cap K=\{1\}$, then $G=HK$ is an *exact factorization*.

There are two questions to answer:
- Given a group $G$ and $H,K<G$, under what condition $G=HK$?
- Given $G$ and $H<G$, under what condition there exists $K<G$ such that $G=HK$?

Two lemmas are used to answer those questions:

# By Order of Group

> [!lemma]
> $G=HK$ iff $|G|=|H||K|/|H\cap K|$.

`\begin{proof}`
$HK=\{hk:h\in H,k\in K\}$ is a set whose cardinal number is $|H||K|/|H\cap K|$. By $HK\subseteq G$, $G=HK$ iff $|G|=|HK|/|H\cap K|$.
`\end{proof}`

# Frattini's argument

> It is mentioned [[MATH/Cards/Nodes/Frattini's Argument#^9wyb80\|here]].

> [!lemma]
> Suppose $G$ is a transitive on $\Omega$. Then $H<G$ is transitive on $\Omega$ iff $G=HG_\omega$ for $\omega\in \Omega$.

`\begin{proof}`
Suppose that $H$ is transitive on $\Omega$. For any $\omega\in\Omega$ and any $g\in G$, define $\omega':=\omega^g$. Since $H$ is transitive, there is $h\in H$ such that $\omega^h=\omega'=\omega^g$. So we have $h^{-1}g\in G_\omega$ and $g=h(h^{-1}g)\in HG_\omega$. Therefore, $G=HG_\omega$.

Conversely, assume that $G=HG_{\omega}$. For any $\omega,\omega'\in\Omega$, there is $g\in G$ such that $\omega^g=\omega'$. As $g$ can be written as $g=xh$ with $x\in G_\omega$ and $h\in H$, there is $\omega^g=\omega^{xh}=\omega^h=\omega'$, i.e., $H$ acts on $\Omega$ transitively.
`\end{proof}`
