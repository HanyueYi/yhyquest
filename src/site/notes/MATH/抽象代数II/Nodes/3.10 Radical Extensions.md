> [!definition]
> We say $F/K$ is a radical extension, if $F=K(u_1,\cdots,u_n)$ such that $u_1^{m_1}\in K$ for some $m_1\geqslant 1$, and for any $i\geqslant 2$, $u_i^{m_i}\in K(u_1,\cdots,u_{i-1})$ for some $m_i\geqslant 1$.

**Facts.** 
- $F_1/K$ and $F_2/F_1$ are radical yield that $F_2/K$ radical.
- $F_1/K$ and $F_2/K$ are radical yield that $F_1F_2/K$ radical.

In this section, we aim to show a polynomial equation $f(T)$ is solvable by radical iff Galois group of $f(T)$ is solvable as a group, which is stated in [[MATH/抽象代数II/Nodes/3.10 Radical Extensions#^7b35db\|#^7b35db]].

# Normal Closure

`\begin{proof}`
Let $F=K(u_1,\cdots,u_n)$. Note that $N$ is a splitting field over $K$ of $S=\{\mathrm{Irr}(u_i,K)=f_i\}$. Let $v$ be a root of one of $f_i$. Then we have an field automorphism $\tau_v:K(u_i)\stackrel{\sim}{\to}K(v)$. By [[MATH/抽象代数II/Nodes/3.2 Splitting Fields, Normal Extension and Separable Extensions#^28f933\|3.2 Splitting Fields, Normal Extension and Separable Extensions#^28f933]], there exists $\widetilde{\tau_v}:N\stackrel{\sim}{\to} N$. This deduces that $F\simeq \widetilde{\tau_v} (F)$ and $v\in\widetilde{\tau_v}(F)$. Note that $N$ is a composite of $\widetilde{\tau_v} (F)$ with $v$ running through all roots of $S$. But $\widetilde{\tau_v}(F)/K$ is radical because $F/K$ is radical. Hence, $N/K$ is radical.
`\end{proof}`

**Remark.** Recall that we always assume that $\mathrm{char} F=0$, then $N/K$ is normal and radical yields that $N/K$ is Galois.


> [!theorem]
> Suppose that $\mathrm{char} K=0$. Let $F/K$ be a finite Galois extension such that $F/K$ is a radical extension. Then $\mathrm{Gal}(F/K)$ is solvable.

`\begin{proof}`
Write $F=K(u_1,\cdots,u_n)$, with $u_1^{m_1}\in K,\cdots,u_n^{m_n}\in K(u_1,\cdots,u_{n-1})$.

Let $m=m_1\cdots m_n$, and let $\zeta$ is a primitive $m$-th root of unity. Note that $\mathrm{Gal}(F/K)$ is solvable iff $\mathrm{Gal}(F(\zeta)/K)$ is solvable iff $\mathrm{Gal}(F(\zeta)/K(\zeta))$ is solvable. 

Let $E_0=K(\zeta)$, and let $E_i=K(\zeta,u_1,\cdots,u_i)$ for all $1\leqslant i\leqslant n$. Consider the following subfields and subgroups

$$\begin{aligned}
&F(\zeta)=E_n\supseteq \cdots\supseteq E_{0}=K(\zeta),\\
&1=H_n<\cdots< H_i=\mathrm{Gal} (F(\zeta)/E_i)<\cdots<H_0=\mathrm{Gal} (F(\zeta)/K(\zeta)).
\end{aligned}$$

We claim that the group series is a solvable series. Note that $u_i^{m_i}\in E_{i-1}$, $E_i=E_{i-1}(u_i)$ and $\zeta^{m/m_i}\in E_{i-1}$, by [[MATH/抽象代数II/Nodes/3.9 Cyclic and Cyclotomic (分圆) Extension#^e267b2\|3.9 Cyclic and Cyclotomic (分圆) Extension#^e267b2]] we have $E_i/E_{i-1}$ is Galois and furthermore is a cyclic extension. It deduces that $H_i\lhd H_{i-1}$ and $H_{i-1}/H_i$ is solvable. Therefore, $H_0=\mathrm{Gal}(F(\zeta)/K(\zeta))$ is solvable and so for $\mathrm{Gal}(F/K)$. 
`\end{proof}`


> [!corollary]
> Suppose $K\subseteq E\subseteq F$ is a finite extension with $F/K$ is radical. Then $\mathrm{Aut}_KE$ is solvable.
{ #5c0107}


`\begin{proof}`
Let $K_0=E^{\mathrm{Aut}_{K}E}$. Then $E/K_0$ is Galois, and $\mathrm{Aut}_KE=\mathrm{Aut}_{K_0}E$. Still $F/K_0$ is still Galois. So WLOG assume $K=K_0$. Let $N$ be the normal extension of $F/K$. Then by [[MATH/抽象代数II/Nodes/3.10 Radical Extensions#^bb62fa\|#^bb62fa]] $N/K$ is also radical. So WLOG assume $F=N$. In summary, we assume $K\subseteq E\subseteq F$ with $E/K,F/E,F/K$ Galois. It deduces that $\mathrm{Gal}(E/K)=\mathrm{Gal}(F/K)\big /\mathrm{Gal}(F/E)$ is solvable.
`\end{proof}`


> [!definition]
> We say $f(x)\in K[x]$ is solvable by radical, if there exists radical extension $R/K$ such that $f(x)$ splits over $R$.


> [!corollary]
> Suppose that $\mathrm{char} K=0$. If $f(x)\in K[x]$ is solvable by radical. Then its Galois group is solvable. 

`\begin{proof}`
Suppose $R/K$ is as in above definition. then $R$ contains a splitting field $E$ of $f(x)$, that is, $K\subseteq E\subseteq R$ and $R/K$ is radical. Then by [[MATH/抽象代数II/Nodes/3.10 Radical Extensions#^5c0107\|#^5c0107]], $\mathrm{Aut}_KE$ is solvable. 
`\end{proof}`


> [!theorem] abel
> Suppose $\mathrm{char} k=0$. Consider the general polynomial $p_n(x)=x^n+a_{n-1}x^{n-1}+\cdots+a_1x+a_0$ of degree $n$ over $K=k(a_0,\cdots,a_{n-1})$. Then it is NOT solvable by radicals, if $n\geqslant 5$. 

`\begin{proof}`
Let $E$ be a splitting field of $p_n(x)$ over $K$. One can prove that $\mathrm{Gal}(k(x_1,\cdots,x_n)/k(f_1,\cdots,f_n))\simeq\mathrm{Gal}(E/K)$ and so $\mathrm{Gal}(E/K)\simeq S_n$ by [[MATH/抽象代数II/Nodes/3.7 Elementary Symmetric Polynomial#^ga6dtn\|symmetric polynomial]]. Then it deduces that $p_n(x)$ with $n\geqslant 5$ is not solvable by radicals.

`\end{proof}`
