> [!definition]
> Let $G$ be a set with a binary operation $G\times G\to G$. We say:
> - $G$ is a *semigroup* if $a(bc)=(ab)c$;
> - $G$ is a *monoid* if further there exists the two-sided identity element $e\in G$;
> - $G$ is a *group* if further $\forall a\in G$, there exists $a^{-1}\in G$ such that $aa^{-1}=a^{-1}a=e$.
