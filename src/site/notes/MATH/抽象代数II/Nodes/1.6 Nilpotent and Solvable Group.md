# Nilpotent Group

> [!lemma]
> Suppose $f:G\to H$ is a group homomorphism and $A\lhd H$. Then $f^{-1}(A)\lhd G$.

`\begin{proof}`
Note that for any $g\in G$, $f(g^{-1}f^{-1}(A)g)=f(g)^{-1}Af(g)=A$ and so $f^{-1}(A)^g\subseteq f^{-1}(A)$. 
`\end{proof}`

> [!definition]
> Let $G$ be a finite group. Let $C_1(G)=C(G)$. Let $C_2(G)=\mbox{inverse image of }C(G/C_1(G))\mbox{ of the projection }G\to G/C_1(G)$. Inductively, define $C_k(G)$ for $k\in \mathbb{N}_{+}$. This gives an increasing series $\left\langle e\right\rangle\lhd C_1(G)\lhd C_2(G)\lhd\cdots$. We say $G$ is *nilpotent* if $C_n(G)$ for some $n\geqslant 0$. 


> [!theorem]
> A finite $p$-group is nilpotent.

`\begin{proof}`
Note that center of $p$-group is non-trivial.
`\end{proof}`
> [!theorem]
> Direct product of nilpotent groups is also nilpotent.

`\begin{proof}`
Note that $C_i(H\times K)=C_i(H)\times C_i(K)$. 
`\end{proof}`

> [!lemma]
> Let $G$ be a nilpotent group. If $H\lneq G$, then $H\lneq N_G(H)$.

`\begin{proof}`
Write $C_0(G)=\left\langle e\right\rangle$. Let $n$ be the largest number such that $C_n(G)<H$. Choose some $a\in C_{n+1}(G)\setminus H$. We claim that $a\in N_G(H)$. Note that $\overline a\in G/C_n(G)$ is in the center, that is, $(C_n(G)a)(C_n(G)h)=(C_n(G)h)(C_n(G)a)$ for all $h\in G$. Therefore, $[a,h]\in C_n(G)$. For all $h\in H$, we have that $aHa^{-1}\in HC_n(G)=H$ and so $a\in N_G(H)$.
`\end{proof}`

> [!proposition]

`\begin{proof}`
One direction is easy.

Now assume that $G$ is nilpotent. First, pick any Sylow subgroup $P$. If $P=G$, we have done. Otherwise $P<G$. If $P\not\lhd G$, then $N_G(P)<G$. However, by [[MATH/抽象代数II/Nodes/1.6 Nilpotent and Solvable Group#^cb650b\|#^cb650b]], $N_G(P)<N_G(N_G(P))$, which contradicts with [[MATH/抽象代数II/Nodes/1.5 Sylow Theorem#^b84lpf\|1.5 Sylow Theorem#^b84lpf]]. Therefore, $P\lhd G$. 

If $p\neq q$ are distinct prime divisor of $|G|$, then for Sylow $p$-subgroup $P$ and Sylow $q$-subgroup $Q$ we have $P\cap Q=1$ and $PQ=P\times Q$ by [[MATH/Cards/Nodes/Normal Subgroups that Intersect Trivially\|this lemma]]. Therefore, $G$ is the inner direct product of its Sylow subgroups.
`\end{proof}`

> [!corollary]
> Let $G$ be a nilpotent group. If $m\mid |G|$, then there exists subgroup of order $m$.

`\begin{proof}`
By [[MATH/抽象代数II/Nodes/1.6 Nilpotent and Solvable Group#^a9c9ed\|#^a9c9ed]] and [[MATH/Cards/Nodes/Sylow Theorems\|Sylow theorems]].
`\end{proof}`

# Solvable Group

> [!proposition]
> If $G$ is nilpotent, then $G$ is solvable.

`\begin{proof}`
Since $G$ is nilpotent, we have $C_1(G)\lneq C_2(G)\lneq\cdots\lneq C_n(G)=G$. Note that $C(G/C_{n-1}(G))=G/C_{n-1}(G)$, then $G/C_{n-1}(G)$ is abelian and so $C_{n-1}(G)\geqslant G'$. Consider $C_{n-1}$. Since $C_{n-1}/C_{n-2}=C(G/C_{n-2})$, we have that $C_{n-1}/C_{n-2}$ is abelian and so $C_{n-2}\geqslant C_{n-1}'\geqslant G''$. Repeat this procedure and we finish the proof.
`\end{proof}`

**Example.** $S_3$ is solvable, but it is not nilpotent.

> [!theorem]
> The followings hold:
> - If $G$ is solvable, then its subgroups and quotient groups are solvable.
> - Let $N\lhd G$. Then $G$ is solvable iff $G/N$ and $N$ are solvable.

`\begin{proof}`
i) Since $H<G$ yields that $H^{(n)}\leqslant G^{(n)}=1$ and $H$ is solvable. For any $K\lhd G$, we have that $(G/K)^{(n)}=G^{(n)}K/K=K/K=1$ and $G/K$ is solvable.

ii) One direction is easy. Define $f:G\to G/N$. Then $(G/N)^{(n)}=G^{(n)}N/N=1$ and $G^{(n)}\leqslant N$. Thus, $G^{(m+k)}\leqslant N^{(k)}=\{e\}$. 
`\end{proof}`
