**Motivation.** Let $G$ be a finite abelian group. If $m\mid n$, then there exists some subgroup $H<G$ such that $|H|=m$.

> [!lemma]
> Let $H$ be a group with $|H|=p^n$. Suppose $H$ acts on finite set $S$. Let $S_0=\{x\in S:hx=x,\forall h\in H\}=S^H=$ fixed points. Then $|S_0|\equiv|S|\mod p$.
{ #acf430}


`\begin{proof}`
Note that $|S|=|S_0|+\sum_{s\notin S_0}|\overline s|$. Since $|\overline s||H_s|=|H|$, then $|\overline s|\equiv 0\mod p$. It follows that $|S_0|\equiv|S|\mod p$.
`\end{proof}`


> [!theorem] Cauchy
> Let $G$ be a finite group and $p\mid|G|$. Then there exists $a\in G$ such that $|a|=p$.
{ #9af89b}


`\begin{proof}`
Let $S=\{(a_1,\cdots,a_p):a_i\in G,a_1\cdots a_p=1\}$. Then $|S|=n^{p-1}$ and $p\mid|S|$. Consider $\mathbb{Z}/p\mathbb{Z}\curvearrowright S$ such that $k\cdot(a_1,\cdots,a_p)=(a_{k1},\cdots,a_{kp})$. Also $S_0=\{(a,\cdots,a):a\in G\}$ is divisible by $p$ by [[MATH/抽象代数II/Nodes/1.5 Sylow Theorem#^acf430\|#^acf430]]. Since $(1,\cdots,1)\in S_0$, then $S_0$ is non-empty and so it has a non-trivial element $(a,\cdots,a)$. Therefore, we have that $a^p=1$ and so $|a|=p$.
`\end{proof}`


> [!definition]
> Let $G$ be a group. 
> - If $\forall x\in G$, $|x|=p^a$, then we say $G$ is a $p$-group.
> - Let $H<G$. If $H$ is a $p$-group, then $H$ is called a $p$-subgroup.


> [!corollary]
> Let $|G|<\infty$. Then $G$ is a $p$-group iff $|G|=p^n$ for some $n$.

`\begin{proof}`
Assume that $|G|=p^n$. Then by Lagrange theorem $G$ is a $p$-group. Conversely, assume that $G$ is a $p$-group. If there is a $q\neq p$ such that $q\mid|G|$, then by [[MATH/抽象代数II/Nodes/1.5 Sylow Theorem#^9af89b\|#^9af89b]] there is a $a\in G$ with $|a|=q$, contradiction.
`\end{proof}`

`\begin{proof}`
Let $S=\{xH:x\in G\}$. Consider $H$ acts on $S$ by $h(xH)=hxH$. Consider $S_0$. Note that $hxH=xH$ iff $x^{-1}hx\in H$ for all $h\in H$ iff $x\in N_G(H)$. Therefore, $|S_0|=[N_G(H):H]$. By [[MATH/抽象代数II/Nodes/1.5 Sylow Theorem#^acf430\|#^acf430]], $|S|\equiv |S_0|\mod p$. 
`\end{proof}`


> [!corollary]
> Let $H<G$ be a $p$-group. If $p\mid[G:H]$, then $N_G(H)\supsetneq H$.

> [!theorem] First Sylow theorem
> Let $G$ be a finite group with $|G|=p^n\cdot m$, $(p,m)=1$. Then $G$ contains a subgroup of order $p^i$ for each $1\leqslant i\leqslant n$. And each subgroup of order $p^i$ is normal in some subgroup of order $p^{i+1}$.

`\begin{proof}`
By induction. When $i=1$, by [[MATH/抽象代数II/Nodes/1.5 Sylow Theorem#^9af89b\|#^9af89b]]. Assume that there exists $H<G$ such that $|H|=p^i$ with $1\leqslant i<n$. It suffices to find a subgroup with order $p^{i+1}$. Since $p\mid [G:H]$, then $p\mid |N_G(H)/H|$ by [[MATH/抽象代数II/Nodes/1.5 Sylow Theorem#^e0a58f\|#^e0a58f]]. By [[MATH/抽象代数II/Nodes/1.5 Sylow Theorem#^9af89b\|#^9af89b]], $N_G(H)/H$ has a subgroup of order $p$, which is of form $H_1/H$ with $H\lhd H_1<N_G(H)$. Then $|H_1|=p^{i+1}$ and $H\lhd H_1$. Now we finish the proof.
`\end{proof}`


> [!theorem] Second Sylow theorem
> Let $|G|=p^n\cdot m$ and $H<G$ a $p$-group. Let $P<G$ be a Sylow $p$-subgroup. Then there exists $x\in G$ such that $H<xPx^{-1}$. In particular, any two Sylow $p$-subgroups are conjugate to each other.
{ #0acdfe}


`\begin{proof}`
Let $S=\{gP:g\in G\}$. Note that $|S|=[G:P]$ and $p\not\mid |S|$. Consider $H$ acts on $S$ by left translation. Then $gP\in S_0$ iff $hgP=gP$ for all $h\in H$ iff $g^{-1}hg\in P$ for all $h\in H$ iff $g^{-1}Hg<P$. Since $|S_0|\equiv |S|\mod S$, then $|S_0|$ is non-empty. Now we finish the proof.
`\end{proof}`

> [!theorem] Third Sylow theorem
> Let $G$ be a finite group, and let $n_p=\mbox{number of Sylow }p\mbox{-subgroups}$. Then $n_p\mid |G|$ and $n_p=kp+1$ for some $k\geqslant 0$. 

`\begin{proof}`
Let $P$ be a fixed Sylow $p$-subgroup. Let $S=\{\mbox{all Sylow }p\mbox{-subgroups}\}$. By [[MATH/抽象代数II/Nodes/1.5 Sylow Theorem#^0acdfe\|#^0acdfe]], $S=\{g^{-1}Pg:g\in G\}$. Note that $G\curvearrowright S$ by conjugation. It follows that $S=|\overline P|=[G:N_G(P)]$. By Lagrange theorem, $n_p\mid |G|$. Consider $P$ acts on $S$. Then $Q\in S_0$ iff $xQx^{-1}=Q$ for all $x\in P$ iff $P\leqslant N_G(Q)$. So $P,Q$ are two distinct Sylow $p$-subgroups of $N_G(Q)$ and so $P=Q$. Therefore, $S_0=\{P\}$ and $|S|\equiv|S_0|=1\mod p$ by [[MATH/抽象代数II/Nodes/1.5 Sylow Theorem#^acf430\|#^acf430]]. 
`\end{proof}`


> [!theorem]
> Let $G$ be a finite group. If $P<G$ is a Sylow $p$-subgroup. Then $N_G(N_G(P))=N_G(P)$.
{ #b84lpf}


`\begin{proof}`
Firstly, note that $N_G(N_G(P))\geqslant N_G(P)$. It suffices to show $N_G(P)\geqslant N_G(N_G(P))$. Since $P$ is a Sylow $p$-subgroup of $N_G(P)$, then $P$ is the unique Sylow $p$-subgroup of $N_G(P)$. Let $x\in N_G(N_G(P))$. Then $N_G(P)^x=N_G(P)$ and $P^x\subseteq N_G(P)$. Therefore, $P^x=P$ and $x\in N_G(P)$. 
`\end{proof}`

**Remark.** $P<G$ is a Sylow $p$-subgroup. Suppose $P\lhd Q\lhd R$, then $P\lhd R$.
