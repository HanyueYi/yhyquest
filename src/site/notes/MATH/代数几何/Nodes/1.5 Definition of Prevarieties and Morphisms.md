`\begin{proof}`
i)->ii) Assume that there exists open sets $U_1,U_2$ such that $U_1\cap U_2=\emptyset$, then we have $U_1^c\cup U_2^c=X$ and $U_i^c$ are closed, which is impossible. 

ii)->iii) If there exists open $U$ such that $\overline U\neq X$, then $\overline U^c$ is an open set and $U\cap \overline U^c=\emptyset$, leading to a contradiction.

iii)->i) If there exist closed set $Z_1$ and $Z_2$ such that $X=Z_1\cup Z_2$ and WLOG suppose $Z_1\neq X$, then $Z_1^c\subseteq Z_1\cup Z_2$ and so $Z_1^c\subseteq Z_2$. Since $Z_1^c$ is open, there is $\overline{Z_1^c}=X$. It deduces that $\overline{Z_2}=Z_2=X$. 
`\end{proof}`

Note that irreducible set is connected.

> Prevariety $X$ is irreducible.

`\begin{proof}`
Define $\mathcal U=\{U\subseteq X:U\mbox{ is an affine open set}\}$. For nonempty open $V\subseteq X$, define $U_1=\cup_{U\in\mathcal U,U\cap V\neq \emptyset} U$ and $U_2=\cup_{U\in\mathcal U,U\cap V=\emptyset}U$. Then $X=U_1\cup U_2$. If there exists $x\in U_1\cap U_2$, then there is $W_1\subseteq U_1$ such that $W_1$ is affine and $x\in W_1$, as $W_f\subseteq W\cap U_1$(?). Similarly, we can find affine $W_2\subseteq U_2$ such that $x\in W_2$. 

Define $\mathcal U=\{U\subseteq X:U\mbox{ is an affine open set}\}$. For nonempty open $V\subseteq X$, define $U_1=\cup_{U\in\mathcal U,U\cap V\neq \emptyset} U$ and $U_2=\cup_{U\in\mathcal U,U\cap V=\emptyset}U$. Then $X=U_1\cup U_2$. If there exists $x\in U_1\cap U_2$, then there is $W_1\subseteq U_1$ such that $W_1$ is irreducible and $x\in W_1$. Similarly, we can find affine $W_2\subseteq U_2$ such that $x\in W_2$. Thus $W_1\cap W_2\neq \emptyset$. Since $W_1\cap W_2$ is an open set of $W_1$, we have $(W_1\cap W_2)\cap (W_1\cap V)\neq \emptyset$. Then $W_2\cap V\neq\emptyset$, contradiction. Therefore, $X=U_1\sqcup U_2$. By connectedness of $X$, $X=U_1$ and $U_2=\emptyset$. Hence, for any open set $U\in\mathcal U$, $U\cap V\neq \emptyset$ and so $X$ is irreducible.
`\end{proof}`


> [!proposition]
> Let $X$ be a prevariety. The closed subsets are DCC.

`\begin{proof}`
For a chain of closed set $Z_1\supseteq\cdots\supseteq Z_k\supseteq\cdots$, since $X=\cup_{i=1}^\ell U_i$ with $U_i$ irreducible, there is $\{U_i\cap Z_j\}$ DCC and so for $\{Z_i\}$.
`\end{proof}`


> [!proposition]
> Let $X$ be a Noetherian topological space, i.e., closed sets satisfy DCC. For any closed set $Z$, there exists unique decomposition $Z=\cup_{i=1}^\ell Z_i$ such that $Z_i$ is irreducible, and $Z_i$ are called irreducible component. 

`\begin{proof}`
Existence: assume $Z$ is the minimal element such that the above property does not hold. Then $Z$ is not irreducible, and $Z=Z_1\cup Z_2$ where closed $Z_i\subsetneq Z$. It deduces that $Z_i=\cup_j Y_j$ and $Z_j=\cup_jW_j$ can be decomposed as union of finitely many irreducible closed sets. So the above property also holds for $Z$, contradiction. 

Uniqueness: let $\cup_{j\in J}Z_j=\cup_{i\in I}W_i=Z$ be distinct decompositions, then $W_i=\cup_{j\in J}(W_i\cap Z_j)$. Since $W_i$ is irreducible, there exists $j$ such that $W_i=W_i\cap Z_j$ and so $W_i\subseteq Z_j$. Conversely $Z_j\subseteq W_{i'}$ for some $i'$ and $i=i'$. Therefore, the decomposition is unique.
