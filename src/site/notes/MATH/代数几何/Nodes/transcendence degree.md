> [!definition]
> A *transcendence basis* of a field extension $L / K$ (or a transcendence basis of $L$ over $K$ ) is a maximal algebraically independent subset of $L$ over $K$. 
> 
> All transcendence bases of a field extension have the same cardinality, called the *transcendence degree* of the extension.
